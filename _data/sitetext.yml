    title: "About Me"
    text: "My Story"
    body: "My name is Collin Kanofsky and I am a senior engineering student at Charlotte Latin School. Throughout my life, I have always loved robots and ended up leading two robotics competition teams where I learned tons of CAD, Leadership, Software, and so many more amazing skills that continute to help me to this day. With this project, the Robopack, I wanted to continue my love for robotics through an impactful and practical means. While I will admit my passion for innovation is what pushes me the most, the possibilities for this project to help others is another big motivator of this project. I hope you enjoy watching my journey and fun as I build this robot!"
