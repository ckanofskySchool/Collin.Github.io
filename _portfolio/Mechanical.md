## Mechanical Planning

### Frame Planning
I started off my mechanical planning for the RoboPack by thinking about the frame of the robot. From my previous robotics experience, I have learned that modularity and the ability to re-use and adjust is essential. To ensure optimal flexability, I chose to use 80/20 tubing, specifically the 1530 & 1515 series tubing shown below for robust structure, flexible attachment points, and premade strong brackets that can be re-used and moved.

### Style Planning
After getting all the functionality down, I plan to use a nice wood to give a natural style to the robot. Another idea I have is to get plastic parts that can cover the machine as well, but that might be more complicated and expensive.
