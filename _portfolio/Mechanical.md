## Mechanical Planning

### Frame Planning
I started off my mechanical planning for the RoboPack by thinking about the frame of the robot. From my previous robotics experience, I have learned that modularity and the ability to re-use and adjust is essential. To ensure optimal flexability, I chose to use 80/20 tubing, specifically the 1530 & 1515 series tubing shown below for robust structure, flexible attachment points, and premade strong brackets that can be re-used and moved.

### Style Planning
After getting all the functionality down, I plan to use a nice wood to give a natural style to the robot. Another idea I have is to get plastic parts that can cover the machine as well, but that might be more complicated and expensive.

## The Build Journey

This is a journey through the build proccess describing how the Robopack's mechanical aspects came to be and the steps taken to get there, Enjoy!

### Setting Off - Brainstorming and Drawing

When I first set out to create the Robopack as a junior, I started by sketching out the ideal Robopack which I envisioned. With a stylist, my ipad, and noteability, I set out to draw how the robopack would look, roughly diagram out how the electronics would work, and get a general idea of the features I wanted.
