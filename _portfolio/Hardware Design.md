## Hardware Planning

### Motors & Motor Controller
I am planning to use CIM motors which I've learned from my robotics teams, the reason for using a CIM motor is due to low costs sitting at around 17$, and the output it produces being 5,330 RPM, with 21.33 in/lbs of torque which is pretty powerfull and should definatly ensure a job well done.
